# Technical Documentation

## Introduction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **PHP**: Version ^7.1.3
- **MySQL**: (Version not specified, but Laravel 5.7 supports MySQL >= 5.6)
- **Composer**: For managing PHP dependencies.
- **Git**: (Optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://[bitbucket username]@bitbucket.org/the-restaurant-boss/the-restaurant-boss.git
   cd the-restaurant-boss
   ```

2. **Install Composer Dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Copy and Configure Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Open `.env` and configure your application, database credentials, mail server, cache, and any other configurations.

4. **Generate Application Key**

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

   This will set the `APP_KEY` in your `.env` file, which is used for encryption.

5. **Run Database Migrations and Seeds**
   Ensure your database is running and the database credentials in `.env` are correct.

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

   This will create the database structure and populate it with any seed data.

6. **Set Up Laravel Passport**

   ```bash
   php artisan passport:keys
   php artisan passport:install
   ```

   Note down the client ID and secret if you're using password grant types.

7. **Serve the Application**
   For development, you can use Laravel's built-in server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   For production, you should set up a web server like Nginx or Apache. Ensure the web root is pointed to the `public` directory and the server is configured to hand off `.php` files to PHP-FPM.

## Codebase Overview

### Directory Structure

#### 2. `routes/`

- **web.php**: Defines routes for web interface, typically returning views.
- **api.php**: Defines API routes, typically returning JSON.
- **console.php**: Defines routes for Artisan commands.

#### 3. `database/`

- **migrations/**: Contains files defining the database schema through Laravelâ€™s Eloquent.

#### 4. `tests/`

- **Unit/**: Contains tests that target a small, isolated portion of the code.
- **Feature/**: Contains tests that target larger areas, possibly interacting with the database or other services.

#### 5. `public/`

- **index.php**: The entry point for all requests to the application and configures autoloading.
- **assets/**: Contains compiled assets like CSS and JavaScript, as well as images and other public-facing files.

#### 6. `resources/`

- **views/**: Contains Blade templates that Laravel will compile and render as HTML.
- **lang/**: Contains translation files, allowing you to internationalize text in your application.
- **sass/**: Contains SASS that will be compiled to CSS.
- **js/**: Contains JavaScript files that might be compiled with Laravel Mix.

#### 7. `config/`

#### 8. `storage/`

- **logs/**: Contains log files generated by the application.
- **app/**: Contains files generated during the operation of the application, like file uploads.
- **framework/**: Used for storing files generated by the framework like session, cache, and compiled view files.
- **oauth-private.key** and **oauth-public.key**: Contain the private and public keys used by Laravel Passport for API authentication.

#### 9. `bootstrap/`

- Contains the `app.php` file which bootstraps the framework and allows it to start serving responses.

### Key Components
